# AizenBank
AizenBank is a university project that is supposed to represent a banking web application.

## Description

This whole project was built using .Net Framework, ASP.MVC technologies and the Business Logic design pattern. The web application lets the users create an account, login to an existing account, reset their password via an email verification code, create up to 4 personal cards, withdraw and deposit money, make transfers to other users or between their cards and see all their transactions history. An admin level was also added to this project, admins being able to see all the registered users, edit some of their data, view their activity, block a card or even delete a user completely.
